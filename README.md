Performance testing using Flamegraphs and the Gemfile. (Gemfile) Lock file is where Bundler records the
exact versions that were installed. This way, when the same library/project is loaded on another machine, 
running bundle install will look at the Gemfile. Running different versions on different machines could lead to broken tests, etc.
